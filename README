# BackboneStrap

Bootstrap your backbone application using BackboneStrap.

BackboneStrap is a set of common practices I use on my Backbone applications.

## App
Use Backbone.App to initialize your main application with:

- A ```navigate``` function used to trigger page change using application router if available.
- A handler for javascript links: add ```js-link``Ì€  css to your links and it will trigger a page change with href value.

Following methods should be overriden with your own logic:

- ```buildRouter``` Must return the router that will be used within your application.


## Router

Use Backbone.StrapApp to initialize .

```javascript
var Router = Backbone.StrapRouter.extend({
    routes: {
        'index': 'index'
    },

    index: function() {
        this.show(HomeView);
    }
});
```

Backbone.history is automatically started at router initialization with following settings:
- silent = false : By default, first url trigger associated router.
- pushState = true : By default, your backbone application will use pushState api.

Note that a new function (`show`) is added on your router.

This function will allow you to display new view in a DOM area.

By default, the selector is '#content' but it can be overriden when your router is created.

```javascript
var myRouter = new Router({
    content: '#my-app',
    silent: true,
    pushState: false
});
```
